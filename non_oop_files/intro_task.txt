Overview

In the previous step, you have created a simple movie application that had a CLI (Command Line Interface) with two basic types of commands:
CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete.

Analytics: Top-rated movies, least-rated movies etc.
We now extend our project to integrate everything you learned so far.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features

Here are the new exciting features at this part!

1. Changing The Data Structure
In the last part, you had a simple dictionary that stored the movie title and rating. In this part, you’ll implement a more complex data structure that can hold more data per movie, for example, the year of the movie.

2. Persistent Storage
Currently, all of your application’s data is stored in-memory. As you probably noticed, when you close the application, your changes are not saved. For example, if you added a movie, it is not saved.

3. Application robustness
Making sure that unpredicted user input cannot break the application. Improving user experience - if an invalid input was given, ask the user for the input again.

4. Step-by-step
Don’t worry, as always - we will complete all the steps gradually, step by steps. By the end of this exercise, you’ll have a magnificent application!
